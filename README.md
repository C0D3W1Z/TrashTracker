Our app, TrashTracker, addresses the pressing issue of improper waste disposal, which significantly impacts recycling efforts and contributes to environmental pollution. TrashTracker is designed to guide users in identifying, categorizing, and properly disposing of waste, ensuring that recyclable materials are correctly sorted and diverted from landfills.

The process begins with users accessing the scanning page, where they can take a photo of the waste they want to dispose of. Once the image is captured, our app leverages an Imbalanced Garbage Classification machine learning model to identify the type of waste from the image. This classification is crucial for determining the next steps in the waste management process.

After the waste is classified, the app identifies the material type, such as plastic, glass, or organic material. The material data is then sent to the Gemini API, which provides detailed information on the environmental impact of the waste. This includes decomposition time, environmental harm, resource use, recycling potential, and its impact on wildlife. This information helps users understand the consequences of improper disposal and encourages responsible waste management.

To further promote recycling, the app integrates with the Google Maps API, allowing users to locate nearby recycling centers. This makes it easier for users to find appropriate disposal points for materials like electronics, plastic, or hazardous waste, streamlining the recycling process.

In addition to helping with immediate waste disposal, TrashTracker offers personalized insights through the progress page. Here, users can track their waste disposal habits and see their progress over time. The app also generates a personalized waste reduction plan, offering tips and actionable steps to reduce waste production and improve recycling habits.

All user data and progress are stored securely in a database, and results are displayed on a results page, allowing users to review their environmental contributions and track improvements.

Overall, TrashTracker provides an effective solution for individuals looking to minimize their environmental impact by improving waste disposal practices and promoting recycling.
